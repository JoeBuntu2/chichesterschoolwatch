      Who are you?
    </h5>
    <p>      
      This site was founded by Joe Cooper, an Upper Chichester tax-payer.
      <i>Note: This site is not affiliated with Chichester School District or any government organization.</i>

      Purpose/Background
    </h5>

    <p>
      Why are taxes so high? That is the typical question of the average Chichester SD tax payer.
      This is especially true of any tax-payer that has shopped for homes in other school districts.
      Homes of similar value in the next township over, often have tax burderns a couple thousand less a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical follow-up question would be 'How do we compare to other school districts'? In order for a tax-payer to
      be able to judge how well a school district is performing in terms of cost-effectiveness, one should
      compare to other schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there has not existed an easy way for tax payers to answer these simple questions.
      My hope is to lower the burden for tax payers to get this information, and arm tax payers with the
      information they need to contribute meaningfully to today's policy discussions.

        paints half of the picture...Nothing wrong with speaking your mind and bringing up problems for
        discussion, but when the only information that you share is negative, that makes you a close minded clown"
