        These numbers are not reliable metrics upon which to compare school district
        cost-effectiveness.<br />
        They don't account for any of the following:
      </p>

      <ol style="max-width: 768px;">
        <li>
          Differences in cost-per-student. Chichester <a [routerLink]='["../cost-per-student"]'>leads the pack</a>
          at 4-5k more per student.
        </li>
        <li>
          New revenue generated from increases in property assessments (business development), such as
          Chichester's huge surplus of revenue from a once-in-a-blue-moon
          <a [routerLink]='["../assessed-increase"]'>{{stats.chiAssessmentBoostFy1819 | thousandSuff }}</a> dollar increase in property values.
        </li>
        <li>
          Budget deficits such as Chichester's <a [routerLink]='["../deficit"]'>{{stats.chiDeficitFy1920 | thousandSuff }}</a> dollar deficit
          this year.
        </li>
      </ol>

      I propose <a [routerLink]='["../cost-per-student"]'>Cost-Per-Student</a> as the metric for comparing districts apples-to-apples.
