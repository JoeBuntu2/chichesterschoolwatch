      <h5>Bartholf Misleads Taxpayers at 5-22-19 Board Meeting</h5>
      <p>
        Last year, Chichester School District's preliminary budget featured a $2 million deficit (which ultimately grew into
        a $3.47 million deficit in the final budget). At the 5-22-19 Chichester School Board Meeting, I asked the school board
        the following question about the preliminary budget deficit:<br />
        <q class="font-weight-bold">How do we plan to resolve the 2 million dollar deficit?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Region 1 board member David Bartholf responded, seizing the opportunity to push the PSERS
        narrative. In a convincing speech, he went to great lengths to suggest that increasing
        pension costs (PSERS) were responsible for the deficit. I have to admit, he did a great job at selling
        his narrative. With his respectable roles as Board Treasurer and Finance Committee member,
        combined with his authoritative delivery, who wouldn't believe him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a look at the video below. What you should know is that
        <span class="font-weight-bold">pensions (PSERS) had absolutely nothing to do with the deficit</span>.
        In fact, Chichester's share of pensions (PSERS) decreased for the second year in a row.
        I cover the actual impact of PSERS on Chichester SD finances extensively and show you how to verify the data yourself in part 1 of this series -

            This segment is taken from the full video of the 5-22-19 board meeting hosted on the district's site. Frank Sill (in maroon) is the older
            gentleman who first responds to the question (albeit not the actual question asked). Mr Bartholf (in blue) delivers his compelling PSERS
            narrative starting at 0:35. Board President, Ruth Anne Baiocco (center) idly stands by and does nothing to stop Mr Bartholf
            from pushing his narrative onto unsuspecting taxpayers.

        <h5>Bartholf's Narrative vs Reality</h5>
        <div class="font-weight-bold bg-info text-white rounded p-2">
          Contender #1: Bartholf's Narrative
        </div>
        <i>Bartholf has to build his case for why money would be used from a PSERS fund
          to cover the deficit. Here are his talking points.</i>
        <ul>
          <li>How the PSERS contribution rate goes up every year.</li>
          <li>How the rate is currently around 33%.</li>
          <li>How they don't have anything built in to the budget to handle rate increases.</li>
          <li>
            How the board has planned for these increases with a genius
            10-year plan where a bunch of tax-payer money has been stashed away in a PSERS
            fund to help ease the burden of future PSERS rate increases.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="font-weight-bold bg-info text-white rounded p-2">
          Contender #2: Reality
        </div>
        <i>Bartholf conveniently leaves out some important details. Most importantly,
          he forgets to mention that PSERS has nothing to do with the deficit.</i>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Remember the question asked is 'How does the board plan to resolve the 2 million dollar deficit?'.
            He neglects to mention how Chichester's share of PSERS has decreased two years in a row and
            has absolutely nothing to do with the deficit.
            See here: <a href="https://www.chichesterschoolwatch.com/blog/2020/2/6/psers-narrative-part-1-actual-impact">Part 1: The Actual Impact of PSERS on Chichester SD</a>.
          </li>
          <li>He mentions increasing contribution rates, but he neglects to mention anything
            about state reimbursement money for PSERS, the fact that this state money covers
            more than half the pensions cost, and have also been increasing every year. (see graph below).</li> 
          <li>
            He boasts about the boards '10-Year Plan', but neglects to mention how they planned once-again to funnel money through
            a fund named after PSERS to cover a deficit having nothing to do with PSERS. This time they planned
            to funnel 2 million dollars through said fund.
