    Cost Per Student - This is likely the best metric on which to compare the cost-effectiveness of
    one district versus another. Simply put, how many dollars does it take to educate each child.
    You will note, that Chichester is far ahead of the pack. You'll notice that even our spending 4
    years ago was more than what districts are currently spending (except for GV, a much, much wealthier district).
    Getting this number in line with other districts is our only hope for having reasonable
    taxes and not crushing home values.
