      This comparision shows the percentage each school district allocates to special
      education. If Chichester was facing some sort of unique special eduction challenge,
      then it should be reflected in the budget. As you will see, Chichester's rate of spending
      is no different than other districts in Delaware County.
      This expenditure is coded as 1200 in the school budgets and defined
      in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.education.pa.gov/Documents/Teachers-Administrators/School%20Finances/Comptrollers%20Office/Chart%20of%20Accounts.pdf">PA Chart of Accounts</a>.

        One go-to strategy of Chichester School Board members (Bartholf & Baiocco in particular),
        is misleading community members into thinking that Chichester is spending
        <a [routerLink]='["../cost-per-student"]'>4-5k more per student</a> than
        other districts due to it's 40% special needs population. Unfortunately, this tactic has
        worked extremely well for board member Bartholf and tends to both 1) rally people against
        and 2) demonize anyone challenging the board on it's spending.
      </p> 
      Things to consider
      <ol>
        <li>
          To believe this Bartholf logic (see picture), one has to accept the premise that within, and only within
          the geo-political boundaries of Chichester School District, we are experiencing some unique medical
          phenomenon that is costing the district <a [routerLink]='["../cost-per-student"]'>4-5k more per student</a>
          totaling 12-17 million in excess spending over peer districts.
        </li>
        <li>
          One must understand that not every special needs kid costs the same. Is it possible that an ADHD student with an IEP
          is deemed 'Special Needs' under state law, but in fact has a negligible impact on cost? Very possible.
          Maybe a better explanation to this misleading 40% statistic is that perhaps IEP's are more commonly leveraged
          in lower income districts as a means of addressing behavior problems.
          That seems more believable that people with special needs children moving here in droves as
          Bartholf <a class="cursor-pointer alert-danger" (click)="open(0)">suggests</a>.
