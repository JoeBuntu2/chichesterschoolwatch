    How much Chichester SD would save if it's costs were in line with other districts.
  </h5>
  <div class="list-group">
    <div class="list-group-item ">
      <span class="badge-pill badge-info center">2</span>For each district, this shows how much
      we would cut in costs if our costs-per-student were the same as that district.

      <p class="mt-3">
        For Example: PennDelco spends
        <a [routerLink]='["/budgets/comparisons/cost-per-student-compared-to-chichester"]'>$5,535 less per student</a> than Chichester.
        If you multiply this
        difference in cost-per-student by Chichester's enrollment (<i>
          I use average enrollment of 3,247
          from the previous 4 years
        </i>) you'll end up with almost <span class="font-weight-bold">18 million</span>
        in cost savings.

        Unfortunately some members of the school board aren't completely straight forward when
        it comes to answering why we are spending this much additional money (see
        <a [routerLink]='["/budgets/comparisons/psers-net-contribution-increase"]'>PSERS</a>).
        Remember to ask yourself this simple question: 'Is this a $12-18 million dollar reason?'
