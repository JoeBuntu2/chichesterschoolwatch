            In this multi-part series, Iâ€™ll cover the actual impact of pensions (PSERS) on
            Chichester School District finances as well as the narratives and tactics that
            are being employed to pin blame on PSERS and divert accountability for district
            spending increases and budget deficits away from the Chichester School Board of Directors.

          Region 1 board member David Bartholf seized the opportunity to push his PSERS
          narrative. In a convincing speech, he went to great lengths to suggest that increasing
          pension costs (PSERS) were responsible for the deficit. I have to admit, he did a great job at selling
          his narrative. With his respectable roles as Board Treasurer and Finance Committee member,
          combined with his authoritative delivery, who wouldn't believe him?

          Have a look at the video below. What you should know is that
          <span class="font-weight-bold">pensions (PSERS) had absolutely nothing to do with the deficit</span>.
          In fact, Chichester's share of pensions (PSERS) decreased for the second year in a row.
          I cover the actual impact of PSERS on Chichester SD finances extensively and show you how to verify the data yourself in part 1 of this series -

              This segment is taken from the full video of the 5-22-19 board meeting hosted on the district's site. Frank Sill (in maroon) is the older
              gentleman who first responds to the question (albeit not the actual question asked). Mr Bartholf (in blue) delivers his compelling PSERS
              narrative starting at 0:35. Board President, Ruth Anne Baiocco (center) idly stands by and does nothing to stop Mr Bartholf
              from pushing his narrative onto unsuspecting taxpayers.
